## Overview of the project

Project: Sentiment Analysis Using NLP

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a sentiment analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on the "Sentiment_Analysis_Dataset". The model is trained to classify text into three sentiment categories: Negative, Neutral, and Positive. The project involves preprocessing text data, building a classification pipeline with TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression, and evaluating the modelâ€™s performance through cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and various visualizations.

## Key Activities
-Data Preparation:
Loaded and inspected the sentiment analysis dataset.
Preprocessed text data by tokenizing, lemmatizing, and removing stopwords.

-Model Building:
Created a machine learning pipeline using TF-IDF Vectorizer and Logistic Regression.
Conducted cross-validation to assess the model's initial performance.

-Hyperparameter Tuning:
Used GridSearchCV to optimize the hyperparameters for better performance.

-Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the model using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
Plotted the confusion matrix and sentiment distribution of predictions.

-Model Saving:
Saved the trained model and TF-IDF Vectorizer using pickle for future use.

-User Interface:
Implemented a function to predict sentiment for user-provided text input.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
-pandas for data manipulation
-numpy for numerical operations
-nltk for natural language processing
-matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
-scikit-learn for machine learning
-pickle for saving and loading models

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of NLP techniques for sentiment analysis. The model achieved good performance on the validation set, and various evaluation metrics were used to assess its effectiveness. The visualizations provide insights into the model's predictions and its ability to classify text accurately. The trained model and vectorizer have been saved for future use or further experimentation.
